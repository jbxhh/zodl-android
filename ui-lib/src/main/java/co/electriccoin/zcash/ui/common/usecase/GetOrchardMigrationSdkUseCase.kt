/**
 * Resolves the real, Rust-backed [OrchardMigrationSdk] for the wallet account the migration flow
 * is actually running against.
 *
 * [OrchardMigrationSdk.new] needs the wallet's network and lightwalletd endpoint (only known once
 * a wallet exists — read from [PersistableWalletProvider]) and the specific account (whichever one
 * is currently selected in the app — Zodl/Keystone or Zashi — via [GetSelectedWalletAccountUseCase],
 * never auto-picked by the SDK itself). This use case is the single seam combining all three, so
 * every migration call site injects just this instead of wiring them separately.
 *
 * The no-arg [invoke] returns non-null: it suspends until a selected account exists (see
 * [AccountDataSource.getSelectedAccount]) and throws if no wallet is persisted by then — a wallet
 * is a precondition for every migration flow, so callers treat absence as a programming error
 * rather than a state to branch on. Callers on general, wallet-independent code paths
 * (`CheckMigrationRecoveryUseCase` runs on every `MainActivity` launch, including a fresh install
 * before onboarding) must therefore gate on wallet existence BEFORE calling this — the account
 * wait would otherwise suspend them indefinitely on a wallet-less install.
 *
 * Unlike `WalletCoordinatorFactory`'s own `OrchardMigrationSdk.new(... account = null)` call (which
 * gates sync before any `Synchronizer`/account selection exists), this always resolves a real
 * selected account whenever a wallet exists.
 *
 * An explicit-account overload [invoke(accountKeyId)] is provided for contexts where the account
 * is known by its storage key ID (e.g. [co.electriccoin.zcash.work.MigrationWorker]) rather than
 * being read from the current selection.
