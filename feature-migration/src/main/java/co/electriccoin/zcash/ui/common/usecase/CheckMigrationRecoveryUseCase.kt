/**
 * Single source of truth for migration re-entry routing AND for starting/reviving migration
 * execution on app-lifecycle events — MainActivity's onStart() and RootNavGraph's
 * secretState-driven redirect both delegate here instead of calling the SDK checks directly, so
 * the two never drift out of sync with each other or with this ordering. Cheap and idempotent
 * (NavigationRouter dedupes identical commands; the driver-start/worker-revival block below is
 * per-account idempotent too).
 *
 * After Task 6 (remove app-open auto-navigation), the ONLY auto-navigation that fires here is the
 * Tor-failure branch: a pending background Tor failure routes to the Sending screen so that
 * MigrationSendingVM's init{} reproduces the exact condition, using its own existing routing to
 * resolve or re-surface the failure. That branch stays scoped to the currently SELECTED account —
 * it's about what to show the user right now, unlike the driver-start/worker-revival block below.
 *
 * All other migration states (RequiresAttention, ReadyToSend, Overdue, Complete, the
 * unprovable-anchor attention state) are reachable exclusively via the home banner + button
 * (HomeVM.onMigrationMessageClick), preventing repeated screen hijacking on every launch during a
 * healthy migration.
 *
 * The driver-start/worker-revival block enumerates EVERY account (2026-08-0X), not just the
 * selected one: `MigrationLiveDriver`/`MigrationDriveOnce.DRIVE_LOCK` are per-account already, and
 * a migration committed for a Keystone account keeps running whether or not that account is
 * currently selected in the UI — this is the sole place migration execution gets triggered from
 * (besides `FinalizeMigrationScheduleUseCase`'s own post-commit start for the account that was
 * just committed), so it must not silently skip a non-selected account. It and the
 * stale-write-ahead-plan clear are NOT navigation — they are retained unchanged in spirit, just
 * widened from one account to all of them.
