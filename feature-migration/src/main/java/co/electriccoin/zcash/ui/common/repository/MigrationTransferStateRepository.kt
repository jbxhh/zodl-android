/**
 * One atomic live readout of the migration engine: the per-transfer states, the tip-estimate pair
 * needed to render them (`OrchardMigrationSdk.estimatedChainTip()`/`estimatedSecondsPerBlock()`),
 * the derived [MigrationState], and whether a due transfer is overdue — all read together from the
 * same call site, at the same instant, so a consumer never pairs a fresh field with a stale one
 * (2026-08-06/07: the ready-to-send flicker this repository's sibling fix closed for the Home banner
 * was exactly this — `scheduledAt` and `hasOverdueTransfers` read at different instants).
 *
 * [estimatedTip] follows [cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.OrchardMigrationSdk.estimatedChainTip]'s own
 * "negative means unavailable" convention — callers fall back to `states.tipHeight` in that case,
 * same as before this type existed.

 * `MIGRATION_DB_ACCESS_MUTEX` (2026-08-07 read/write-separation design). `hasOverdueTransfers` is
 * derived from the same pure transfer-states read: `ready && action == BROADCAST` is exactly the
 * "should the engine broadcast this now" signal the mutating `hasOverdueTransfers()` call itself
 * checks internally.
 *
 * The single shared shape for every caller that wants a display-only readout without triggering
 * any mutex-gated engine work — the Home/Progress cold-start fallbacks and the live driver's own
 * priming publish (see [co.electriccoin.zcash.work.MigrationLiveDriverImpl]) all call this instead
 * of hand-rolling the same five-field construction three times and risking them drifting apart.

/**
 * The live migration engine's readout, published by `MigrationLiveDriverImpl`'s own loop after
 * every step it drives (and periodically during a long re-armed wait — see the driver's own kdoc).
 * No screen calls `OrchardMigrationSdk.getMigrationTransferStates()`/`estimatedChainTip()`/
 * `estimatedSecondsPerBlock()` on its own poll anymore — those used to mean the Progress screen's
 * independent reads and the live driver's prove/broadcast calls competed for the SDK's
 * single-threaded DB I/O executor (`SdkDispatchers.DATABASE_IO` — a genuinely single OS thread, per
 * its own kdoc: no WAL, so all `RustBackend`/`MigrationRustBackend` calls serialize onto it,
 * regardless of which Kotlin DB-mutex lane a given call is on), producing a long white-screen wait
 * whenever the user opened Progress right as the driver was mid-step (e.g. proving, which blocks
 * that one thread for real wall-clock seconds). Observing this instead costs nothing: [observe]
 * never blocks — it just replays whatever the driver last saw, published from reads the driver was
 * already going to do as part of its own already-serialized loop, not a second concurrent caller.
 *
 * Tagged per account, mirroring [PendingMigrationScheduleRepository] — a Zodl and a Keystone
 * account migrating in parallel each get their own independent published value.
 *
 * [observe] returns `null` until the live driver has published at least once for that account this
 * process's lifetime (e.g. before its very first loop iteration completes, or if no migration is
 * `in_progress` so the driver never runs at all) — callers needing a value in that window fall back
 * to one direct SDK read of their own, same as before this repository existed.
