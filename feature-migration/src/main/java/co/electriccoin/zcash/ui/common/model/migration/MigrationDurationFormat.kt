/**
 * Formats a migration plan's total span so it reflects whatever interval the current
 * [cash.z.ecc.android.sdk.OrchardMigrationSdk] implementation actually schedules transfers at —
 * minutes for the compressed debug cadence, hours for the real one — instead of a hardcoded
 * "~24 hours" that only matched production timing.
 *
 * [fineGrained] (default: testnet builds) keeps minute resolution above one hour ("~1 h 15 min")
 * — the whole testnet plan spans ~1-2 h (12-block buckets), so integer-hour bucketing collapsed
 * most transfers into an identical "~1 hours" label. Mainnet keeps the coarse hour display.
 *
 * A duration describing an UPCOMING moment — a transfer's own "due in" hint, the header's
 * total-span/remaining estimate — is floored at [TESTNET_PRIVACY_FLOOR_SECONDS]/
 * [MAINNET_PRIVACY_FLOOR_SECONDS] (2026-08-03, decision with the user): never reveal a migration
 * timing more precise than that, since a tighter number could help correlate this wallet's
 * upcoming broadcast across the network before it happens. [fineGrained] doubles as the network
 * selector for which floor applies, matching its own existing default derivation, so callers that
 * pin [fineGrained] for a deterministic test get a deterministic floor for free.
 *
 * [applyPrivacyFloor] (default `true`) lets a caller opt OUT for an "ago" duration on an
 * ALREADY-SENT/mined transaction (2026-08-06, revised decision with the user): the correlation
 * risk the floor guards against is specific to revealing precise timing before/around the moment
 * of broadcast; once a transfer is mined, its exact block time is already public on-chain
 * regardless of what this app's own UI shows, so flooring "Sent 1 min ago" to "Sent ~10 min ago"
 * has no remaining privacy benefit — it only makes the row less informative. Every OTHER caller
 * (all upcoming/future estimates) keeps the floor at its previous default.
