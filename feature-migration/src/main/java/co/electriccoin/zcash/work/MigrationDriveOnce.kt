/**
 * What the caller should do after one [MigrationDriveOnce.run] call.
 *  - [ReArmed]: a step ran to completion and already re-armed the WorkManager chain (via
 *    `MigrationScheduler.schedule` inside `reArm`) to [delay] — the CALLER's own next check
 *    (the live driver's loop) should wait the same [delay]; the worker discards this (it's
 *    already re-armed, nothing more to do).
 *  - [LockBusy]: another caller was mid-step; THIS call did nothing (no `reArm` ran). The
 *    worker MUST explicitly self-schedule using [retryDelay] here, or a lost race silently
 *    kills the durable WorkManager chain (nothing else will re-arm it). The live driver just
 *    waits [retryDelay] and tries again.
 *  - [Terminal]: the migration reached `Complete`, or a state that intentionally never
 *    self-schedules (`Rebuild`, `Replan`, `Expired`, `NetworkError`) — all of these need a
 *    user-driven reschedule/re-plan (or are simply done), so nothing here re-arms. Neither caller
 *    should re-arm; the live driver stops. `InvalidNote` is NOT in this list (SDK Task 9): a
 *    genuinely-unknown broadcast rejection is withheld (`Blocker::AwaitingReevaluation`) rather
 *    than terminally failed, so [handleExecuted]'s `InvalidNote` arm re-arms instead of stopping —
 *    see its doc comment.
