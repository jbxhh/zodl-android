/**
 * Drives the real [CheckMigrationRecoveryUseCase] — the app-open re-entry router — against the
 * shared stateful [FakeOrchardMigrationSdk] instead of the ad-hoc `mockk` SDK the existing
 * [co.electriccoin.zcash.ui.common.usecase.CheckMigrationRecoveryUseCaseTest] uses. The difference
 * is that `getMigrationState()` is computed from a real seeded migration plan, so the recovery
 * decision is exercised against a self-consistent in-progress world.
 *
 * What is asserted:
 *  - A HEALTHY in-progress migration consults the worker-run-state check (revival would fire if
 *    the worker were absent) and does NOT auto-navigate (Task 6: only a pending Tor failure
 *    auto-navigates on app-open).
 *  - A completed migration with no saved plan skips reconciliation entirely.
 *  - A worker merely SCHEDULED for later (armed, not yet due) is accelerated to run now — the
 *    app-open forward-progress trigger, for users with no reliable background execution.
 *
 * Scope note: `getWorkerRunState`/`scheduleNow` are injected specifically so this file's
 * reconciliation/acceleration assertions don't need a real WorkManager-initialised `Context`
 * (the production defaults call `WorkManager`/`AlarmManager`, neither of which work under a plain
 * unit-test `Context` mock); this file drives them against the FakeSdk-derived InProgress state.
